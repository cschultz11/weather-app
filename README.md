# Weather App
This project was a simple weather app, designed to include some specific cities, along with an image representation of the
weather at that time. This application was meant as an introduction to both Swift, which I had never used before, as well as
an introduction into accessing databases, in this case the US National Weather Service from whom the data is from.
Using XML Code to parse this data, I offered the client an ability to input city codes, but was instead turned down in favor of a more simplistic design of specific cities. As such, I added a handful of more cities onto the app beyond those the client specified which resulted in positive reviews and assurance from the client.
